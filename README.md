Weekend 5 Challenge Hard Mode: Swapping Mongoose for SQL
TECHNOLOGY SWAP OUTS!

For this challenge, its all about working with an existing project and making technology changes. You will need to take the existing jQuery and replace it with Angular. jQuery needs to be completed remove. Nuke all the existing files, the code, and even npm uninstall! Then, bring in Angular! Note that are a couple obvious things we have not covered in Class. This was by design. One of the focuses here at the end of Tier 2 is to become dependent on documentation and research. We will not note what these points of research are, it is your responsibility to examine the project and discover all the points that need to be replaced, research the Angular implementation of the previous jQuery functionality, and ensure that the functionality remains in tact.

Existing Project: https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/prime_peer_db_pg_01

HARD MODE Now that you have replaced jQuery for Angular, now replace SQL with MongoDB! You will obviously need a new database, no need to worry about data migration from SQL to MongoDB.

PRO MODE Replace Express.js with Hapi.js (WAIT! What the heck is Hapi!? Something new, you will obviously need to do some research!)
